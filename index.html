          <p>From "Discover Your Destiny with the Monk Who Sold his Ferrari" by Robin Sharma</p>

          <p>You are far greater than you have ever dreamed of being. And no matter what you are experiencing in your life right now, trust that all is good and unfolding
            in your best interests. It may not look pretty, but it is exactly what
            you need to learn for you to grow into the person you have been destined to become.
          </p>

          <p>Everything occurring in your life has been perfectly orchestrated to inspire your maximal evolution as a human being and bring you into your true power. Learn
            from life and allow it to take you where you are meant to go - it has
            your highest interests in mind.</p>

          <p>From "The Power of Positive Thinking" by Dr.Norman Vincent Peale</p>

          <p>This is one of the greatest laws in the universe, fervently did I wish I'd discovered it as a very young man, it dawned upon me much later in life, and I have
            found it to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest discovery, outside
            my relationship with God and the great law, briefly and simply stated, is that if you think in negative terms you'll get negative results. </p>

          <p>That is the simple fact that is at the basis of an astonishing law of prosperity and success. In three words, believe and succeed</p>

          <p>From "The Endorphin Effect" by William Bloom</p>

          <p>The slightest use of these strategies is better than none. The slightest attempt to trigger endorphins, to remember your location in a universe beyond
            Blobsville, to smile internally, can create the minuscule leverage that ultimately
            sets change rolling.Even in your worst mood, on a day when you are cursing all creation, you need to remember the power of a small gesture in the right
            direction. Remember the power in the tiniest act of connection.</p>

          <p>The slightest glimmer of a good vibration may unfold to redeem the whole situation. What a terrible mood needs is a glimpse of light at the end of the
            tunnel.</p>

          <p>From Paulo Coelho "The Lesson of the Butterfly"</p>

          <p>A man spent hours watching a butterfly struggling to emerge from its cocoon. It managed to make a small hole, but its body was too large to get through it.
            After a long struggle, it appeared to be exhausted and remained absolutely
            still.The man decided to help the butterfly and, with a pair of scissors, he cut open the cocoon, thus releasing the butterfly.However, the butterfly's body was
            very small and wrinkled and its wings were all crumpled.The man
            continued to watch, hoping that, at any moment, the butterfly would open its wings and fly away. Nothing happened; in fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its
            brief life dragging around its shrunken body and shrivelled wings,incapable
            of flight.</p>

          <p>What the man - out of kindness and his eagerness to help - had failed to understand was that the tight cocoon and the efforts that the butterfly had to make in
            order to squeeze out of that tiny hole were Nature's way of training
            the butterfly and of strengthening its wings.</p>

          <p>From "Life Lessons" by Dave Pelzer</p>

          <p>There can be endless reasons why folks may not like us, no matter what we do. In the end, we must have the will to simply be ourselves.When you please others
            in the hope of being accepted, you lose your self-worth in the process.As
            elementary as this sounds: to help yourself, you have to be yourself. Be the best person you can possibly be.</p>

          <p>Stand up for yourself. Without being rude and arrogant, speak your piece.</p>

          <p>Every day do your best and if there are those who disagree with you, it's not the end of the world. By being more self-assured, you're not only taking a stand
            but you will actually learn more quickly to adapt to a negative environment</p>

          <p>From "Transform your life - A Blissful Journey" by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso</p>

          <p>What does 'engaging in spiritual practice' mean? Essentially it means transforming the mind - overcoming delusions and negative actions and cultivating
            constructive thoughts and actions.</p>

          <p>Someone controlled by theiranger lives within a paranoid view of the world, surrounded by enemies of his or her own creation. The false belief that everyone
            hates him can become so overwhelming that he might even go insane, the
            victim of his own delusion</p>

          <p>From the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali</p>

          <p>Happiness is within you, but since you do not know the springs of your own inner experience you attribute that happiness to someone else. You like him because
            he scratches your back.</p>

          <p>If another person says you are an idiot, you are unhappy, and that unhappiness is in you; but you think it comes from someone else and that if he (whom you

          <p>From "The Endorphin Effect" by William Bloom</p>

          <p>The slightest use of these strategies is better than none. The slightest attempt to trigger endorphins, to remember your location in a universe beyond
            Blobsville, to smile internally, can create the minuscule leverage that ultimately
            sets change rolling.Even in your worst mood, on a day when you are cursing all creation, you need to remember the power of a small gesture in the right
            direction. Remember the power in the tiniest act of connection.</p>

          <p>The slightest glimmer of a good vibration may unfold to redeem the whole situation. What a terrible mood needs is a glimpse of light at the end of the
            tunnel.</p>

          <p>From Paulo Coelho "The Lesson of the Butterfly"</p>

          <p>A man spent hours watching a butterfly struggling to emerge from its cocoon. It managed to make a small hole, but its body was too large to get through it.
            After a long struggle, it appeared to be exhausted and remained absolutely
            still.The man decided to help the butterfly and, with a pair of scissors, he cut open the cocoon, thus releasing the butterfly.However, the butterfly's body was
            very small and wrinkled and its wings were all crumpled.The man
            continued to watch, hoping that, at any moment, the butterfly would open its wings and fly away. Nothing happened; in fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its
            brief life dragging around its shrunken body and shrivelled wings,incapable
            of flight.</p>

          <p>What the man - out of kindness and his eagerness to help - had failed to understand was that the tight cocoon and the efforts that the butterfly had to make in
            order to squeeze out of that tiny hole were Nature's way of training
            the butterfly and of strengthening its wings.</p>

          <p>From "Life Lessons" by Dave Pelzer</p>

          <p>There can be endless reasons why folks may not like us, no matter what we do. In the end, we must have the will to simply be ourselves.When you please others
            in the hope of being accepted, you lose your self-worth in the process.As
            elementary as this sounds: to help yourself, you have to be yourself. Be the best person you can possibly be.</p>

          <p>Stand up for yourself. Without being rude and arrogant, speak your piece.</p>

          <p>Every day do your best and if there are those who disagree with you, it's not the end of the world. By being more self-assured, you're not only taking a stand
            but you will actually learn more quickly to adapt to a negative environment</p>

          <p>From "Transform your life - A Blissful Journey" by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso</p>

          <p>What does 'engaging in spiritual practice' mean? Essentially it means transforming the mind - overcoming delusions and negative actions and cultivating
            constructive thoughts and actions.</p>

          <p>Someone controlled by theiranger lives within a paranoid view of the world, surrounded by enemies of his or her own creation. The false belief that everyone
            hates him can become so overwhelming that he might even go insane, the
            victim of his own delusion</p>

          <p>From "Gift from an Angel" by Eileen Goble</p>

          <p>Always see the good in all things, even if the darkest side is what is shown to you. There remains the good to be recognized. Look with unconditional love, and
            you cannot fail""Fear not and be thankful, know your every need is
            being taken care of. If you are thankful, then you drive out fear. Do not worry about what is ahead, the journey ahead is assured. Have you not been brought
            forth so far in spite of all fears. Have you not travelled safely
            through all the trials, sorrows and tribulations of life. You never walk alone.</p>

          <p>Look back only to recognize the beauty you left behind, do not regret the past, bless it for had you not travelled by that path you would not be here. So your
            karma brings sorrows and anxieties. Fear not, have faith and courage
            for others look to you to see the light shining forth, maybe unconsciously, they still do, for they know you have something special which is helpful and good.
            Let go, surrender - lay down your problems, do not try to unravel
            the knots, it only gets tighter as you pull it.</p>

          <p>Let it go,concentrate with all your heart on love, knowing the knot will be unravelled if you stand back. Fill yourself with love and ask truly for guidance,
            your problems will be solved.</p>
